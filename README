Simple universal remote control.  I couldn't find any examples
online that included multiple buttons and both raw and encoded
codes, so I decided to toss this on the net in case someone else
wants to try making their own universal remote.  See Remote2.ino
for more details, and Remote2_Fritzing.fzz for a Fritzing model
showing how I wired it up on a breadboard.

Note that if you're not using Visual Micro to work on arduino
projects in visual studio, you only need Remote2.ino and Codes.h.
There's a modified version of Ladyada's rawirdecode app in contrib
for convenience.
